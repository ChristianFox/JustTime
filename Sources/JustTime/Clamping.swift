/// A property wrapper that automatically clamps its wrapped value in a range.
///
/// ```
/// @Clamping(range: 0...1)
/// var alpha: Double = 0.0
///
/// alpha = 2.5
/// print(alpha) // 1.0
///
/// alpha = -1.0
/// print(alpha) // 0.0
/// ```
///
/// - Note: Using a Type whose capacity fits your range should always be prefered to using this wrapper; e.g. you can use an UInt8 for 0-255 values.
